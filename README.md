# Deep Neural Network

## Introduction
The class DNN implemented in `dnn.py` can be used to construct a general L layered neural network.

The api provides a `train` function and a `predict` function.

The motivation for this comes from Neural Networks and Deep Learning of [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/).

## Model
$Z = A^{1}$
